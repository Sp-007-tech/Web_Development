    <p>The Earth is around 4.6 billion years old according to scientists. The Earth is the densest planet in the Solar
        System. The Earth’s atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), argon (.93%), and carbon
        dioxide (0.03%).<br>[1]
        The gravity between the Earth and the Moon causes the tides on Earth. The Earth was once believed to be the
        centre of the universe. The rotation of the Earth is gradually slowing down. Earth is the only planet not named
        for a mythological god or goddess. Earth is the most dense planet in the solar system.<br>[2]
        The Earth is the only planet in our solar system not to be named after a Greek or Roman deity. Earth is the
        third planet from the Sun and is the largest of the terrestrial planets. The Earth was formed approximately 4.54
        billion years ago and is the only known planet to support life.</p>
